# Recs_Search_Ads_papers
This Repo is a collection of academical and industrial papers that I studied (also highly recommended) related to Computing Advertisements, CTR prediction, Personalized Recommendation System, Search Relevance. This is not only a summary of work and study journey, I also hope this can help people who are interested in this industry. All the papers are from the internet. Please advise to remove immediately if any infringement caused.<br>
